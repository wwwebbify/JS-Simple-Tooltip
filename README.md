#### Usage

This tooltip is meant to be as basic and lightweight as you can get. After including the JavaScript into your JS file, simply add the HTML attribute 'data-tooltip="Your custom tooltip content here!"' to enable and display your tooltip.

If you want a specific tooltip to never leave the bounds of the screen, add the attribute ' data-bindToScreen ' to the elements html. 
If you want all tooltips to stay within the bounds of the page, change the JS var bindToScreen to true.

You can also change how far the tooltip is offset from your mouse using the JS var Yoffset. This measurement is in pixels will be relative to the top of the screen. So the default -7 will offset the tooltip 7px above the mouse pointer.

This project is open and free, so what ever you want with it. Just put a star on it if you use it, and let me know if you experience any bugs or have any suggestions.

ENJOY!
